# README - CS 3310 Assignment 4

## Overview
This project, developed for CS 3310, implements a linked list data structure in Python and demonstrates various sorting and searching algorithms, including insertion sort, quicksort, linear search, and binary search. The program reads data from a CSV file, populates a linked list with the data, and performs different sorting and searching operations.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Access to a terminal or command prompt
- A CSV file containing game data (named `games.csv`)

## Setup and Execution

### Step 1: Save the Project Files
Download and save the project files to a directory of your choice. Note that `Assignment_4.py` and `games.csv` must be located in the same directory for the program to function.

### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory
Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the project files are located.

```bash
cd path/to/project_directory
```

### Step 3: Verify Python Installation
Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system by running:

```bash
python --version
```
or 
```bash
python3 --version
```

### Step 4: Running the Program
Run the program using Python:

```bash
python Assignment_4.py
```
or 
```bash
python3 Assignment_4.py
```

The program will read the data from `games.csv`, populate a linked list, perform sorting and searching operations, and output the results to the terminal.

## Input
The `games.csv` stored in the same directory as the main program.

## Output
The program outputs the results of various operations, including:
- The first five elements of the linked list before and after sorting.
- The results of linear and binary search tests.
- The average time taken for searches.
- The breakpoint value `m` for repeated searches.
